# Stock Market Analysis

Predicting future stock price movements is a complex and challenging task in financial analysis and investment. In this project, I develop a predictive model that utilizes time-related features to estimate the stock price interval for the next two days. I analyze daily stock price data from ten companies in the FMCG sector, listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, covering a span of four years. In addition to focusing on one selected stock to predict its price range and assess its historical volatility—a crucial measure of risk in financial markets—I also examine the correlation among these ten FMCG stocks to understand how they move in relation to each other.

Volatility analysis plays a vital role in understanding market uncertainty, as higher volatility indicates greater potential for both gains and losses. By studying past price fluctuations, I aim to evaluate the stock’s risk and stability over time, providing valuable insights for informed investment decisions. Additionally, I employ statistical models to forecast the stock’s volatility for the upcoming two days, helping investors navigate market dynamics with greater confidence. The correlation analysis further helps identify relationships between different stocks, which can be useful for portfolio diversification and risk management strategies.
